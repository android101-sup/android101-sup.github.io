        <ol>
            <li><b>Choose your application name.</b> Let's call ours <b>Sup</b>. In general, keep these in mind for application names:</li>
            <ul>

            </ul>
            <li><b>Choose a company domain.</b> Let's use <b>android101.uci.com</b>. In general, make sure to follow the same rules as above.</li>
            <li>You can change the project location if you'd like, but we're going to leave it as is.</li>
            <li>On the next page, <b>select Phone and Tablet</b>. Choose <b>minimum SDK as API 16: Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean)</b>. This indicates the lowest API that this app is guaranteed to work in.</li>
            <li><b>Click next</b>, and then Android Studio will begin installing the SDK components.</li>

        <h3>Activity</h3>

        <p>Open up <span class="code">/java/com/uci/android101/SupActivity.java</span>.</p>
        <p>Android apps are made up activities, which are actions that users can take. They're responsible for managing an application's visual interaction with its users. This is the basic unit of the Android app. Generally, we want ot use just one activity per page.</p>

        <h3>Layout</h3>

        <p>Open up <span class="code">/res/layout/activity_sup.xml</span>.</p>
        <p>By default, this will show the Design view. At the bottom of the main window, you can switch between Design and Text. For our purposes, <b>select Text</b>. If the Preview tab is open, you can see this tab is useful for previewing your layouts. However, it does burn a lot of memory, so to reduce that, you can collapse this tab.</p>
        <p>This is a resource file that allows us to define a set of UI objects (or widgets) and their positioning. The default layout contains two components: <span class="code">RelativeLayout</span> and <span class="code">TextView</span>. We'll be seeing shortly what these look like.</p>
        <p>For widgets, keep in mind that they all require <span class="code">android:layout_width</span> and <span class="code">android:layout_height</span>. For layout. Layout widgets require <span class="code">android:orientation</span>. These are fairly self explanatory, but we'll explain these widgets' properties a little later on.</p>

    <div class="sct sct-primary">
        <h3>Android Manifest</h3>

        <p>Open up <span class="code">/manifests/AndroidManifest.xml</span>.</p>
        <p>Each Android app must have one <span class="code">AndroidManifest.xml</span> named exactly that. It defines your package information and all of the components that are required to make this app, including activities, services, broadcast receivers, content providers, etc. It also manages securities and permissions.</p>
        <p>In your <span class="code">AndroidManifext.xml</span>, you can see that <span class="code">SupActivity</span> is defined for you by default. It includes a couple of <span class="code">intent-filters</span> to tell your app that you would like to open this activity when it starts up.</p>

            <li>Your emulator should start up and show your app running.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Note: if you are using your own device, you may need to <b>enable USB debugging</b> in your Developer Tools.</p>
